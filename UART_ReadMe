UART Bit Stream Structure
Start Bit:
The UART transmission always begins with a start bit, which is a logic low (0) signal.
This indicates to the receiver that a new data frame is about to be transmitted.
Data Bits:
After the start bit, the actual data bits are transmitted.
The number of data bits is typically 8 bits.
The data bits are sent starting from the least significant bit (LSB).
This data represents the byte being communicated, and both the sender and receiver must agree on the number of bits being transmitted.
Parity Bit:
The parity bit is a feature used for error detection.

It checks if the number of 1’s in the transmitted data bits is even or odd.

If parity is enabled:

Even parity: The parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1’s in the data is odd, making the total count even.
Odd parity: The parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1’s in the data is even, making the total count odd.
Stop Bit(s):
The transmission ends with one or more stop bits, which are always logic high (1).
Stop bits provide a buffer between the end of one data frame and the start of the next.
They ensure the receiver has enough time to process the data before another transmission begins.
Idle Line:
After the stop bit(s) are sent, the UART line returns to an idle state, which is a logic high (1).
The line remains idle until the next transmission begins with a new start bit.
The idle state allows the system to differentiate between periods of activity and inactivity on the communication line.
